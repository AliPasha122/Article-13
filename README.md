Dust accumulation in household and indoor environments remains an unresolved issue
despite advancements in cleaning technologies. It contributes to respiratory problems,
allergies, and deteriorates electronic devices' efficiency. This research proposes a Smart Dust
Mitigation System (SDMS) that uses electrostatic repulsion, air ionization, and intelligent
airflow control to minimize dust deposition. The system integrates electrostatic grids, ion
generators, HEPA filtration, and automated cleaning mechanisms to repel dust particles
from surfaces and direct them toward a centralized filtration unit. This paper explores the
working principles, feasibility, and potential impact of SDMS, supported by scientific
reasoning and experimental data.
